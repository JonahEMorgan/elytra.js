## What is this for?
This library will make it easier to develop simple applications such as dashboards, surveys, or anything which relies on connecting data to HTML. It can be used for prototyping or small projects and is not intended to replace React in your enterprise application.

## Why is it so small?
I didn't spend much time adding extra features.
